Installation Instructions:

It is recommended to download this game using visual studio. There is multiple module py files because of wanting to keep the code organized and not be jumbled around in the main code. The main code is called game_project.py but click on game project.sln to open in visual studio.


Bugs:

The score tracker was an area I was struggling in so it may not work properly to keep track of scoring, sometimes it bugs out or works.
